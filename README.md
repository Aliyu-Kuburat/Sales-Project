### Project Overview
---

The objective of the data analysis project is to gain comprehensive insights into the sales performance of an education company throughout the previous year. Through a thorough examination of diverse aspects of the sales data, the goal is to pinpoint trends, formulate recommendations based on data, and develop a profound comprehension of the company's performance spanning the last six years.

### Insights







### Data Sources

Sales data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales. cvs" file of the company, containing detailed information about each sale made.

## Tools

- Excel (Data cleaning) 
- SQL (Data Analysis)
- Power BI (Data cleaning and creating reports)

### Data Transformation

A)  In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed
 
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing value
3. Data cleaning and formatting

B) 
 **Basic Data Transformation**

   - I Perform data profiling to understand data quality and confirm data accuracy and completeness. 
   - Checked the table view of data before transforming the data
   - ID has 2 blank values across the dataset (to be deleted)
   - The title has a 1689 date data value and every other piece of information are N/A (to be deleted)
   - email has 1689 date data value and every other information is N/A (to be deleted)
   - pricetotal has 2 blank values across the dataset (to be deleted)
   - priceQa has 2 blank values across the dataset (to be deleted)
   - priceCustomer has 2 blank values across the dataset (to be deleted)
   - created has 2 blank values across the dataset (to be deleted)
   - category has 1689 date data value and every other information is N/A (to be deleted)
   - buyerName has 1689 date data value and every other information is N/A (to be deleted)
   - buyerEmail has 58,222 null values, but there are values across other column in the dataset 
    (null values not to be deleted)
   - buyerPhone has a 1689 date data value and every other information is N/A (to be deleted)

The Dataset now contains 54,432 information.

2. Data Types check  
3. Remove empty and error dataset with conditions
4. Rename Column (Order Id, Material Title, Partners Email, Cost of Material, Company shares, 
   Partners Share, Date, Category code,Customer Name, Customer Email, Customer Phone and Material Category.    
5. Create and tables ( Material,Partners, Customer)

**Breaking into multiple tables**

To create a well-structured data model in Power BI, it's a good practice to split your data into multiple tables, 
typically into lookup tables and fact tables. The goal is to reduce redundancy, improve data integrity, 
and enhance the efficiency of queries. 

**Breakout tables and columns**

**Material Table**:
Columns: Order Id, Material Title, Category Code, Material Category
Partners Table:
Columns: id, Partners Email
Customer  Table:
Columns: id, Customer Name, Customer Email, Customer Phone
Date     Table
Columns: Date, Year, Month, hour

**Sales Table**:
Columns: id, Date, Cost of Material, Company Shares of Sales, Partners Share of Sales

**Cleaning of breakout tables and columns**

**Material Table**:
Select the columns "Material Title", "Category" and "Category Code."
Remove duplicates.


**Partners Table**:
Follow similar steps for the "Partners Email" column.

**Buyer Table**:
Follow similar steps for the columns related to buyers.

**Date Table**
Columns: Date, Year, Month, hour, Day No, Month No

**Sales Table**:
Select the columns related to sales: "Date," "Cost of Material," "Company Shares of Sales," "Partners Share of Sales."

### Load data for modelling.
 Connect Tables if it doesn't connect automatically and check relationships

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- What is the overall sales trend?
- What are the top 10 educational Materials?
- What are the peak sales period by hour of day
- Cost of material by Month and Year
- Revenue generated by day of week
- Total revenue
- Company profit
- Number of customers
- Number of orders
- Material category
- Number of order by week day
- Average order per day
- Average order by Month
- Number of partners
- Total Partners revenue
- Cost of Material by category
- Number and Sum of order by year
- Running total
- 
### Data Analysis

I mostly used Excel and Power bi for this project. I had to use SQL only to extract Count and Sum of Material by Months and years using below query

```sql
WITH RankedMaterials AS (
    SELECT
        Month,
        Year,
        MaterialTitle,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Month, Year ORDER BY SalesAmount DESC) AS Rank
    FROM
        YourTableName -- Replace with your actual table name
)
SELECT
    Month,
    Year,
    MaterialTitle
FROM
    RankedMaterials
WHERE
    Rank <= 10;
``` 

### Results
- 

### Recommendations

Based on the anaysis, I recommend the following actions

- There should be a customer order detail information named Suggestions

There should be a buyerID for easy customer identifications Named order details id
- There should be a Material id
- Cusomer and partners id
- Expenses information.

### Limitations

- Remove null values: Null values without relevent information was removed
- Some Blank columns with relevent information was replaced with zero
